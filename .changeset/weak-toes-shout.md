"pushkin-cli": minor
---

Added the `use-dev` command, which substitutes a local development version of the specified Pushkin utility package(s) (`pushkin-api`, `pushkin-client`, and/or `pushkin-worker`). You can also use this same command to revert to the previously used published version of the package with the `--revert` option.
