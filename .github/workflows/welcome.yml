            Thanks for opening this issue! We will investigate the matter and get back to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, double check that your issue:
            
               - Includes any relevant code snippets and CLI output. If possible, copy/paste the error text rather than screenshotting (although screenshots will also be helpful for some front-end issues). Make sure to include the code that produced the issue within blocks set off by triple backticks (```).
               - Includes the version number of each of the following: pushkin-cli, experiment/site templates, Docker Engine, and Node.js. In some cases, it may also be helpful to include the version numbers of other components, e.g. pushkin-api, pushkin-client, pushkin-worker, yarn, jsPsych plugins, etc.
               - Links to any existing issues/discussions/PRs which might be relevant.
               - Pertains to the interaction between jsPsych and Pushkin (if relevant), rather than jsPsych itself. Otherwise, raise it in jsPsychâ€™s discussions page or issues. A good workflow for developing Pushkin experiments is to first create a working example as a plain jsPsych experiment. If your experiment doesnâ€™t do what you expect in plain jsPsych, your issue isnâ€™t with Pushkin.
