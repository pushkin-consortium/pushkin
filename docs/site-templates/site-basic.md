# @pushkin-templates/site-basic

The basic template provides everything you need for building a bare-bones Pushkin site. It does not include authentication, forum, or dashboard features.

## Installing the exp-basic template

Make sure you've first created a new directory in which you'll build your Pushkin site. From within your new site directory, run:

```
pushkin i site
```

Select the main Pushkin distribution and `@pushkin-templates/site-basic` from the list of available templates. Then choose which version you want (the latest is typically recommended).
