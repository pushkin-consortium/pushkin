### Pushkin provides a customizable, scalable ecosystem for massive online psychological experiments.

The goal of the Pushkin project is to help researchers efficiently create and maintain an online laboratory. These websites typically take &mdash; and Pushkin primarily supports &mdash; a citizen-science approach to participant recruitment, in which strategies such as gamification and virality motivate participation. As such, Pushkin aims to include everything researchers need for their online labs, including (but not limited to) customizable website and experiment templates, streamlined site deployment, and database tools. With Pushkin, researchers can focus more on experiment design and less on the intricacies of modern web development.

It's recommended for new users to start by [installing Pushkin and its dependencies](./getting-started/installation.md) and completing the [quickstart tutorial](./getting-started/quickstart.md), in which they'll create a simple demo site. Since Pushkin uses [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) to build experiments, it's also recommended that users consult the jsPsych documentation if they are not previously familiar with this software. From there, users might want to consult the materials on Pushkin's [site](./site-templates/site-templates-overview.md) and [experiment templates](./exp-templates/exp-templates-overview.md).

!!! note
    You're viewing version 4.0 of the Pushkin documentation, which corresponds to version 4.0 of [pushkin-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pushkin-cli), the primary software in the Pushkin ecosystem. Other Pushkin packages and templates are independently versioned, and any compatibility constraints with pushkin-cli are noted on their respective documentation pages.
