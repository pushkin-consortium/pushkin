# Install Required Software

## AWS CLI

[Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) the AWS CLI. Install the version for your operating system, not the Docker image.

Configuration steps will follow on the [next page](./configure-aws-and-ecs-clis.md).

## ECS CLI

Install [ECS CLI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli). (Do only the first page. There's no need follow the steps on the 'configuration' page. The Pushkin CLI will handle this for you.)

*Note that the ECS CLI is no longer being actively maintained, so we may probably migrate in the near future.*
