### Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces for Pushkin

**What is GitHub Codespaces?**
GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment powered by VSCode that allows you to develop entirely in the browser. This service provides a complete, configurable dev environment without the need to install software or configure your local machine.

**Why Use GitHub Codespaces for Pushkin?**
For Windows users encountering issues with local installations of "pushkin", GitHub Codespaces offers a seamless alternative. It eliminates environment-specific issues and ensures you can get up and running quickly, with all the necessary tools and settings pre-configured.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Accessing Codespaces:**
   - Visit the main github codespaces page and set up a blank codespace
   - If it's your first time, you might need to set up a plan or request access, as Codespaces is a paid feature with a free tier available.
   - Note: since pushkin is installed via the command line, you do not need to open codespaces from the pushkin main repository 

2. **Setting up Your Environment:**
   - Once in Codespaces, it will automatically create a development environment based on the repository's settings.
   - Wait for the environment to build. This process might take a few minutes, depending on the project's dependencies and configurations.

3. **Running Pushkin:**
   - The terminal in Codespaces acts just like your local one. Once the environment is ready, you can use the same commands you would locally to run "pushkin".

**Next Steps:**
After setting up your environment in Codespaces, you can proceed just as you would locally. The installation process from here mirrors the quickstart. For further instructions and how to use "pushkin", please refer to the [Pushkin Quickstart](../quickstart/README.md) documentation.
