.. _website_experimentsJS:

experiments.js
=====================
``front-end/src/experiments.js`` importants components for each experiment on the website and exports them as React modules. ``experiments.js`` is created and maintained automatically by ``pushkin prep`` based on the experiments in the ``experiments`` folder. It is unlikely that this file would need to be edited manually.
