    <Card.Img src={require("../assets/images/aboutPage/AboutUs.jpeg")} />
    <Card.ImgOverlay>
      <Card.Title as="h1" style={{marginTop:'12rem'}}>
        Who We Are

      </Card.Text>
      <Card.Text as="h4">

      </Card.Text>

  </Card>

Add a Team Member In About Page
-------------------------------

To add a team member in the about page, open ``People.js`` located in ``components/TeamMember``, it should be an array of objects look like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

  const people = [
    { 
      name: 'Team Member Name', 
      image: 'Template.png', 
      description: 'Enter team member description here.' 
    },
    { 
      name: 'Team Member Name', 
      image: 'Template.png', 
      description: 'Enter team member description here.' 
    },
    { 
      name: 'Team Member Name', 
      image: 'Template.png', 
      description: 'Enter team member description here.' 
    },
  ]

Each object contains three properties: `name`, `image` and `description`. Edit the `name` and `description` properties in ``People.js``.

To add a profile picture of the team member. Copy the image file into the ``assets/images/teamMember`` folder. 

Then edit the image property in ``People.js``, make sure the name of the image file and the `image` property match, including the extension name, like: ``Josh.jpg``.
